Actually Follow</h1><p class="post-date">Last updated on April 29, 2020 - <a href="/tbl">Try our FREE newsletter</a> 👀</p></div><div class="single-post__post"><h3>Sick Policies Almost Never Work</h3><p>How many times have you gotten sick from doing therapy? You probably have a sick policy in place, right? I&#8217;ve always had a sick policy in place. And yet&#8230;</p><p>These are things that have happened in my therapy sessions.</p><ul class="styled-list-asterisk"><li>A mom called to let me know my patient just vomited all over her car. She was running late, but she was on her way!</li><li>A patient had diarrhea all over my treatment room, which apparently had been happening at home for the last 3 days.</li><li>A dad brought his child to therapy even though they both had been diagnosed with THE FLU the day before.</li><li>A patient with a fresh cold wiped his nose on my arm, my leg, and most of my toys.</li><li>I showed up for a home visit and everyone in the house, including my patient, had a stomach bug. They acted as if there was nothing wrong.</li></ul><p>These people all had one thing in common: they signed off on my sick policy before we ever started therapy.</p><p>Working with children and trying to stay well is difficult no matter what. They say you eventually develop immunity to nearly everything. But after 20 years as a therapist, I can still count on having at least two bad colds and one stomach bug every year.</p><p>I actually know some grown adults (who DO NOT work in healthcare) who haven&#8217;t thrown up in decades. I can&#8217;t even begin to relate to that.</p><h3>My Sick Policy Was Not Very Effective</h3><p>You would think, then, that I would have a bullet-proof sick policy that was easy to understand and enforce. Turns out it&#8217;s not so simple.</p><p>For a lot of years my basic strategy was this:</p><ul class="styled-list-asterisk"><li>Create a two-page sick policy based on a mishmash of sick policies from other therapists and local schools.</li><li>Add a signature line.</li><li>Add it to the stack of onboarding papers I give to every parent during an initial evaluation.</li><li>Ask the parent to sign all the papers.</li><li>Continue to treat children with contagious illnesses as if none of the above had ever happened.</li></ul><p>My sick policy was an afterthought. But I was too caught up in the day to day operations of my practice to really address the issue.</p><p>Also, all of my therapist friends were doing the exact same thing.</p><p>I could have done a better job of enforcing my sick policy, but that’s hard.</p><h3>Enforcement Makes You Feel Like The Bad Guy</h3><p>Enforcing a sick policy is not easy for many reasons:</p><ul class="styled-list-asterisk"><li>Sick children often don’t act sick, so parents don’t take illnesses seriously.</li><li>Kids are sick all the time.</li><li>Other therapists don&#8217;t enforce their sick policies.</li><li>Children who have weak immune systems would miss a lot of therapy if you strictly enforced your sick policy.</li><li>Parents may not understand how illnesses are spread.</li><li>Parents may think that they’re doing something wrong by skipping therapy.</li><li>Parents may be concerned they will be charged for missed sessions.</li><li>Enforcing boundaries ain’t easy.</li></ul><p>I could keep going, but you get the idea.</p><h3>Creating A Friendly, Enforceable Sick Policy Is Possible</h3><p>The good news is that you can create a solid sick policy that families will actually follow. But you have to go about it from two angles:</p><ul class="styled-list-asterisk"><li>Your sick policy has to be short and easy to understand.</li><li>You have to train families to follow the policy.</li></ul><h3>People Respect Written Policies</h3><p>Which sounds more professional?</p><ul class="styled-list-asterisk"><li>“Just give me a call if your child is sick and we’ll reschedule.”</li><li>“It’s my policy to cancel therapy when a child is sick.”</li></ul><p>When you tell someone it’s your POLICY to do something, you come across as someone who has respect for herself.</p><p>When you hand someone a WRITTEN policy, it’s like handing them a contract. It looks and feels more official. Most people won’t argue with a written policy, especially if they know about it before they fully commit to working with you.</p><h3>Getting Sick = Less Money</h3><p>Let’s cut to the chase: if you can’t treat, you can’t get paid. If you get sick because you treat sick patients, you can’t treat healthy patients. If you spread illnesses to other kids on your caseload, you will end up having more cancellations over time.</p><p>I once worked in a clinic where I was forced to “clock out” if my patients didn’t show up. Flu season was brutal. Some days I would have 3 or more cancellations.</p><p>The clinic wouldn’t pay me for that time, so I had to use my PTO to cover those hours.</p><p>At the end of the year most of my PTO had gone to covering days when I was sick or when my patients were sick.</p><p>That clinic had a sick policy but it was almost never enforced. And don’t even get me started on the cleaning policy.</p><p>The clinic lost money because of illnesses. And so did I.</p><h3>How To Create A Better Sick Policy</h3><p>You don’t have to overthink it, but there are some easy tweaks you can make to your existing policy that will make it more likely to be followed.</p><p>And if you don’t have a sick policy, now’s the time to create one.</p><h3>First Of All, Don&#8217;t Call It A Sick Policy</h3><p>“Sick Policy” just sounds negative. A “Sick Policy” is a document that is created to keep people out of your therapy session.</p><p>That’s why I started calling my sick policy a “Health and Wellness Policy”.</p><p>Health and wellness are things that we all want. It&#8217;s good to have a policy that helps us achieve something we want, versus having a &#8220;sick policy&#8221; that exists to push people away.</p><p>It sounds friendlier and everyone loves a good euphemism.</p><p>You may think that changing the name is just coddling people who should know better, and I hear ya on that.</p><p>But as they say in the South, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar (unless they&#8217;re fruit flies, but that&#8217;s another story).</p><p>Once I changed the name of my policy, it was so much easier to talk about it in a way that inspires compliance.</p><h3>Keep It Short &amp; Simple</h3><p>I learned the hard way that giving families a 2-page sick policy was the best way to make sure they don’t read it.</p><p>I wanted to make sure I covered every possible germy scenario in my sick policy. But it doesn’t matter how many symptoms you list if no one reads the list.</p><p>I was able to get much more compliance by simplifying the language and keeping it on a single page.</p><p>Besides, your health and wellness policy should be more of a conversation starter than an encyclopedia of reasons for canceling therapy. Handing them the policy is only the first step in the process.</p><h3>Make It Look Good &amp; Keep It Friendly</h3><p>How do you feel about this sick policy?</p><p class="text-center"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25810" src="http://local.potc-custom/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bad-sick-policy.png" alt="bad sick policy" width="1442" height="704" srcset="http://local.potc-custom/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bad-sick-policy.png 1442w, http://local.potc-custom/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bad-sick-policy-600x293.png 600w, http://local.potc-custom/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bad-sick-policy-300x146.png 300w, http://local.potc-custom/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bad-sick-policy-1024x500.png 1024w, http://local.potc-custom/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bad-sick-policy-768x375.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1442px) 100vw, 1442px" /></p><p>It’s a big block of ugly text. And it sounds so negative. When I read that I feel like I’m already in trouble with the principal.</p><p>The school is just trying to cover it’s behind, but who’s going to read it? The most likely scenario is that parents will just let the school decide when their children are too sick to be there. They probably won’t even think about the policy. They’ll just deal with it when they get the phone call.</p><p>But how about this policy?</p><p class="text-center"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25811" src="http://local.potc-custom/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/health-wellness-policy.png" alt="health and wellness policy" width="808" height="1050" srcset="http://local.potc-custom/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/health-wellness-policy.png 808w, http://local.potc-custom/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/health-wellness-policy-600x780.png 600w, http://local.potc-custom/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/health-wellness-policy-231x300.png 231w, http://local.potc-custom/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/health-wellness-policy-788x1024.png 788w, http://local.potc-custom/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/health-wellness-policy-768x998.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p><p>It’s short, easy to read, and friendly.</p><p>It doesn’t try to shame you into staying home. It just asks you to contact the therapist if someone’s not feeling well.</p><p>“We can always reschedule if necessary.” The implication here is that we can probably work this out together. And the child’s session can be made up. Everyone’s happy.</p><p>There are no threats or consequences. And the therapist promises to give the parents the same respect.</p><h3>Tips For Making Your Policy Stand Out</h3><p>Your challenge today is to revamp your sick policy (or create one if you don’t have one). Follow these tips and you can’t go wrong.</p><ul class="styled-list-asterisk"><li>Don’t call it a sick policy! Give it a friendlier name.</li><li>Make it short and simple. You don’t need to cover every symptom.</li><li>Using larger text and plenty of white space makes it easier to read.</li><li>Keep it on one page.</li><li>Make it look friendly. A free <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canva</a> account will be your best friend for this.</li><li>Put your contact information on the page.</li><li>Encourage parents to work with you: “Let’s work together to stay healthy.”</li><li>Reassure parents that you’re going to do the same thing for them: “I promise to reschedule therapy if I’m not feeling well.”</li><li>Let them know their child won’t be left high and dry: “We can always reschedule the session.”</li><li>Don’t think of it as <i>paperwork</i>. Think of it as a conversation starter.</li></ul><h3>Spread the Word</h3><p>Email it to all your patients right now. Let them know you’ve updated how you are handling illnesses in your practice. Ask them to please call or text you if someone in their house isn’t feeling well. And promise them that you’ll show them the same kindness.</p><p>Print it out and offer it to all your families during their next appointments. People can delete emails, but they can’t delete you standing in front of them, smiling and offering them a colorful piece of paper.</p><h3>Bring It Up A Couple Of Times A Year</h3><p>I like to remind parents about my sick policy at the beginning of the flu season every year. As soon as flu season hits the news channels in September or October, I email a friendly policy reminder to all of my families.</p><p>I remind them again in the spring when the weather starts warming up.</p><h3>Make Parents Want To Follow It</h3><p>Make sure your families know that you are a reasonable human being. You’re not going to cancel for every single sniffle.</p><p>Some kids would never go to therapy if it was canceled every time they were sick. You can pretty quickly tell which kids are safe for therapy and which ones should probably stay home.</p><p>Once parents realize you will make a rational, fact-based decision about therapy, they will be more likely to call before bringing a vomiting child to therapy.</p><p>It’s very important to make a good faith effort to reschedule the missed appointment. Even if the only opening you have is weeks away, offer it. Let them know that you are committed to helping their child get the full benefits of your services.</p><h3>Don’t Charge For Missed Appointments</h3><p>Cancellation fees are tricky. They can strain the relationships you have with your families.</p><p>Pediatric therapy isn’t the same as a Botox appointment. When you are treating a child, you are treating the family. And that requires a great deal of trust.</p><p>Cancellation fees are difficult to enforce without making families resent you. And that causes all sorts of problems when you need them to buy-in to your treatment approach.</p><p>If you insist on charging for cancellations, loosen your policy when parents cancel because of an illness. If parents worry that they’ll be punished on their next invoice if they cancel, your sick policy will be unenforceable.</p><p>Will some parents game the system and say their child is sick just to avoid a cancellation fee? Probably. And who can blame them? But suspending your cancellation fees for illnesses will only help you. It will make your sick policy enforceable.</p><h3> You Treat The Whole Child</h3><p>That’s why we’re having this discussion. Part of treating the whole child is protecting them from illnesses in any way you can.<br /> Your sick policy is part of your holistic treatment approach. Once you view it that way, enforcement becomes much easier.</p></div></section><section class="in-post__section"><div class="in-post__section__wrapper container"><div class="in-post__image" ><div class="image__wrapper"> <img src="http://local.potc-custom/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/checklist.png" alt="side-image mockup"></div></div><div class="in-post__form"><div class="in-post__form__text"><h4 class="text"><span class="uppercase-bold">BOOTSTRAP YOUR PRIVATE PRACTICE</span><br /> Download <span class="green-text italic">The Ultimate Pediatric Private Practice Checklist</span> for <span class="uppercase">FREE!</span></h4></div><form method="post" id="sideImage"> <input type="text" placeholder="First Name" name="first_name" required /> <input type="email" placeholder="Email" name="email" required /><div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px;" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="license" tabindex="-1" value="" autocomplete="false" /></div><div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px;" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="list" tabindex="-1" value="" autocomplete="false" /></div><p><button class="form-submit" type="submit">Sign Me Up!</button></p></form></div></div></section><footer id="site-footer" class="site-footer" ><div class="footer__info" ><div class="footer__info--top"><p><span class="green-text">all rights reserved &copy; 2020 &nbsp; |&nbsp; </span><a href="/">pediatricOTcourses.com</a> &nbsp;<span class="green-text"> | </span>&nbsp; <span class="green-text white-space">unique continuing education</span> &nbsp;</p></div><div class="footer__info--bottom"> <a href="/disclosure">Disclosure</a> &nbsp;<span class="green-text"> | </span>&nbsp; <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> &nbsp;<span class="green-text"> | </span>&nbsp; <a href="/tbl">TBL Newsletter</a></div></div></footer> <script type='text/javascript' id='cookie-notice-front-js-extra'>/* <![CDATA[ */ var cnArgs = {"ajaxUrl":"http:\/\/local.potc-custom\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php","nonce":"65a04896d1","hideEffect":"fade","position":"bottom","onScroll":"0","onScrollOffset":"100","onClick":"1","cookieName":"cookie_notice_accepted","cookieTime":"2592000","cookieTimeRejected":"2592000","cookiePath":"\/","cookieDomain":"","redirection":"0","cache":"1","refuse":"0","revokeCookies":"0","revokeCookiesOpt":"automatic","secure":"0","coronabarActive":"0"}; /* ]]> */</script> <script type='text/javascript' src='http://local.potc-custom/wp-content/plugins/cookie-notice/js/front.min.js?ver=1.3.2' id='cookie-notice-front-js' defer></script> <script data-minify="1" type='text/javascript' src='http://local.potc-custom/wp-content/cache/min/1/wp-content/themes/potc-custom/js/sf-submit-c959053e081a9a91305d8ccceb7f2d08.js' id='sf-submit-js-js' defer></script> <script type='text/javascript' src='https://unpkg.com/micromodal/dist/micromodal.min.js?ver=1.0' id='modal-js-js' defer></script> <script type='text/javascript' src='http://local.potc-custom/wp-includes/js/wp-embed.min.js?ver=5.5' id='wp-embed-js' defer></script> <div id="cookie-notice" role="banner" class="cookie-notice-hidden cookie-revoke-hidden cn-position-bottom" aria-label="Cookie Notice" style="background-color: rgba(83,190,180,1);"><div class="cookie-notice-container" style="color: #fff;"><span id="cn-notice-text" class="cn-text-container">We use cookies to make our website work better.
